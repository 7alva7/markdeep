# Starship Template

This is a template for the [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep)
markdown processor. Modify in any text editor and load it in your
browser to create a document.

## Bridge

![ ](icon.png width=128px) This template uses a h1 header as the title
by default. You can modify that behavior by downloading and editing
[`starship.js`](https://morgan3d.github.io/markdeep/templates/starship/starship.js) and setting `h1TitleInput: false`.

The h1 option works well with many third-party Markdown tools and
agentic Markdown output.

To change the browser favicon, put a `icon.png` file in the same
directory or modify the icon URL in `starship.js`.

### Site Installation

To install site-wide, download
[`starship.js`](https://morgan3d.github.io/markdeep/templates/starship/starship.js)
and
[`markdeep.min.js`](https://morgan3d.github.io/markdeep/latest/markdeep.min.js)
and install them on your local machine, website, or intranet in a
fixed location.


### Tachyons

In special relativity, a faster-than-light particle would have
spacelike four-momentum, unlike ordinary particles that have time-like
four-momentum.

While some theories suggest the mass of tachyons is imaginary, modern
formulations often consider their mass to be real, with redefined
formulas for momentum and energy.

Additionally, since tachyons are confined to the spacelike portion of
the energy–momentum graph, they cannot slow down to subluminal
(slower-than-light) speeds.

The dark cloud of dust and gas is a region in the Orion molecular
cloud complex, where star formation is taking place. Colour images
reveal a red colour that originates from ionised hydrogen gas (Hα)
predominantly behind the nebula, and caused by the nearby bright star
Sigma Orionis. Magnetic fields channel the gases, leaving the nebula
into streams, shown as foreground streaks against the background
glow.

A glowing strip of hydrogen gas marks the edge of the enormous cloud,
and the densities of nearby stars are noticeably different on either
side.

## Helm Controls

Spaceship maneuvering uses thrusters for rotation (RCS) and orbital
changes (OMS), flywheels (CMGs) for stability, and techniques like
gravity assists to navigate space by controlling pitch, roll, yaw, and
trajectory, relying on Newton's laws in a vacuum where fins don't
work. 

Pilots use control panels, joysticks, or computers for precise
movements like docking, changing orbits, or maintaining attitude.

Reaction Control System (RCS)
: Small thrusters (cold gas or liquid) positioned around the craft to
  provide precise rotations (pitch, roll, yaw) and small translations
  (up, down, left, right).

Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs)
: Spinning flywheels inside the spacecraft; changing their spin
  direction creates torques that rotate the entire vehicle without using
  fuel.

Gimbaled Thrusters
: Main engines can swivel (gimbal) to direct thrust, causing rotation.

Magnetorquers
: Devices that interact with Earth's magnetic field to provide torque,
  common for Earth-orbiting satellites.

Orbital Maneuvers (Orbital Burns)
: Firing main engines for significant changes in speed and orbit, like
  transferring to a new orbit or escaping gravity wells.

Gravity Assist (Slingshot)
: Using a planet's gravity to alter a spacecraft's speed and direction, saving fuel.

### Details

A fast moving spacecraft scoops up hydrogen from the interstellar
medium using an enormous funnel-shaped magnetic field (ranging from
kilometers to many thousands of kilometers in diameter); the hydrogen
is compressed until thermonuclear fusion occurs, which provides thrust
to counter the drag created by the funnel and energy to power the
magnetic field.
